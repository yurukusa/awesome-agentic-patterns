## Problem

The "assistant" model—working one-on-one with an agent in a sidebar, watching it work, ping-ponging back and forth—limits productivity and scalability. As models become more autonomous and capable, the human becomes the bottleneck as the feedback loop. You can only run one agent at a time when you're watching it in a sidebar.

## Solution

Shift from the **assistant model** to the **factory model**: spawn multiple autonomous agents that work in parallel, check on them periodically, and focus your time on higher-level orchestration rather than being the feedback loop.

**The factory mindset:**
- Send off multiple agents to work on different tasks
- Check in on them periodically (30-60 minutes later)
- Focus on setting up automated feedback loops (tests, builds, skills)
- Optimize for parallelism and autonomy

**The assistant model is dying because:**

1. **Limits parallelization**: You can only effectively run one agent when watching it
2. **Human as crutch**: You become the feedback loop when you should be setting up automated loops
3. **Wrong optimization**: Sidebar UX optimizes for watching, not for autonomous work
4. **Holds back progress**: Slower models work better in sidebar, better models work better autonomously

**The evolution:**

| Stage | Model | Human Role | Agent Behavior |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Past** | Assistant | Watch everything, provide feedback | Frequent check-ins, interactive |
| **Present** | Hybrid | Set up automated loops | Mixed interactive and autonomous |
| **Future** | Factory | Orchestrate and review | Fully autonomous, minimal human contact |

**Key insight:** With models like GPT-5.2 Codex that can work autonomously for 45+ minutes, watching them in a sidebar is wasteful. You should be able to spawn 10 such agents and check on them all later.

## How to use it

**Transitioning from assistant to factory:**

**1. Shift your time investment:**

```yaml
# Assistant model (old)
time_distribution:
  watching_agent_work: 80%
  actual_development: 20%

# Factory model (new)
time_distribution:
  setting_up_automated_loops: 30%
  spawning_and_orchestrating: 20%
  review_and_integration: 50%
```

**2. Build automated feedback loops:**

Instead of being the feedback loop yourself, set up:
- Test commands that agents run automatically
- Build commands that verify correctness
- Skills that encapsulate common operations
- Linters and formatters that agents use

**3. Use appropriate models for each mode:**

- **Interactive mode**: Use "trigger happy" models like Opus for quick tasks
- **Factory mode**: Use "lazy" research-oriented models like GPT-5.2 Codex for autonomous work

**4. Embrace asynchronous workflows:**

```pseudo
# Old workflow (assistant)
user → agent → user → agent → user → agent → result

# New workflow (factory)
user → spawn(agent1) + spawn(agent2) + spawn(agent3)
→ do something else
→ check back later
→ integrate results
```

**Practical example from AMP:**

AMP is killing their VS Code extension because they believe:
- The 1% of developers on the frontier only need to do 20% of their work in an editor
- They aim to get that to 10% or 1%
- The sidebar is dead for frontier development
- Factory model enables more effective use of autonomous models

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**

- **Massive parallelization**: Run multiple agents simultaneously
- **Better use of human time**: Focus on orchestration, not watching
- **Scales with model capability**: More autonomous models = more effective factory
- **Reduced latency**: Don't wait for agent to finish each step
- **Higher throughput**: Multiple tasks completed in parallel

**Cons:**

- **Loss of control**: Can't steer agent in real-time
- **Delayed feedback**: Might not see issues for 30-60 minutes
- **Setup overhead**: Requires robust automated feedback loops
- **Harder to debug**: When things go wrong, less visibility into process
- **Tooling requirements**: Need good monitoring and check-in mechanisms

**When factory doesn't work:**

- Exploratory work where you don't know what you want
- Tasks requiring frequent human guidance
- Complex domain knowledge not captured in skills/docs
- Quick iterations where interactive feedback is faster

**The "last 20%" principle:**

> "For the 1% of developers that want to be most ahead... they only need to do the last 20% of their work in the editor. And we think we can get that to 10% or 1% or something."

The factory model doesn't eliminate the editor—it reduces it to the final integration work.

**Related to "Sidebar is Dead":**

The factory model is why AMP is killing their VS Code extension. The extension optimized for the assistant model (sidebar), but the future is the factory model (CLI, spawning, autonomous work).
